Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

Context & Objectivity:\n  - Write the summary from an objective, third-person perspective.\n  - Explicitly mention the full name of the entity or relation at the beginning of the summary to ensure immediate clarity and context.\n6. Conflict Handling:\n  - In cases of conflicting or inconsistent descriptions, first determine if these conflicts arise from multiple, distinct entities or relationships that share the same name.\n  - If distinct entities/relations are identified, summarize each one *separately* within the overall output.\n  - If conflicts within a single entity/relation (e.g., historical discrepancies) exist, attempt to reconcile them or present both viewpoints with noted uncertainty.\n7. Length Constraint:The summary's total length must not exceed 600 tokens, while still maintaining depth and completeness.\n8. Language: The entire output must be written in English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) may in their original language if proper translation is not available.\n  - The entire output must be written in English.\n  - Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n---Input---\nRelation Name: (Audio, Microphones)\n\nDescription List:\n\n```\n{\"Description\": \"The Audio subsystem detects the presence of two microphones.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"The Audio subsystem detects the presence of two microphones.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"The Audio subsystem has detected the presence of microphones.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"The Audio subsystem detects two connected microphones.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"The Audio subsystem has detected two connected microphones.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"The Audio subsystem has detected and is currently interfacing with microphones.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"The Audio system detects the presence of two microphones.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"The Audio subsystem detects the presence of Microphones.\"}\n```\n\n---Output---",

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty.

The Vision subsystem is responsible for detecting the presence of connected devices, specifically identifying when cameras are available for use.\n\nUpon detection, the Vision subsystem establishes an interface with the detected hardware. The descriptions indicate variability in the quantity of devices recognized; in some instances, the subsystem detects and connects to a single camera, while in others, it identifies and interfaces with multiple cameras. This suggests the system is dynamic and capable of handling different hardware configurations ranging from one unit to a plurality of cameras.",
